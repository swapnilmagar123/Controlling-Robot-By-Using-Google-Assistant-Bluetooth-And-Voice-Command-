Controlling Robot Using Google Assistant, Bluetooth, and Voice Command
Controlling Robot Using Google Assistant, Bluetooth, and Voice Command: This project involves designing and implementing a robotic control system that enables users to operate a robot through voice commands issued via Google Assistant. By integrating Bluetooth technology, the robot receives and executes commands in real-time, facilitating hands-free operation. The project encompasses both software development, involving the creation of a mobile application for voice command processing, and hardware design, including the robot's structural and electronic components. This innovative solution demonstrates the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, providing a practical application for smart home automation and enhancing accessibility for users.
